report a bug
============

In the case you have issues, please report them to the project
bug tracker: https://github.com/svinota/pyroute2/issues

It is important to provide all the required information
with your report:

* Linux kernel version
* Python version
* Specific environment, if used -- gevent, eventlet etc.

Sometimes it is needed to measure specific system parameters.
There is a code to do that, e.g.::

    $ sudo make test-platform

Please keep in mind, that this command will try to create
and delete different interface types.

It is possible also to run the test in your code::

    from pprint import pprint
    from pyroute2.config.test_platform import TestCapsRtnl
    pprint(TestCapsRtnl().collect())
